The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are equipped with several sensors that can be used for a variety of
applications. The LiDAR sensor is capable of accurately measuring the distance to nearby objects using lasers, and
has a range of up to 5 meters and a scan rate of up to 60 fps. The Angle Random Walk Error error of Accelerometer
and Gyroscope are 180 μ/√hz and 0.007°/s/√hz respectively [1]. The camera on the iPhone is a high-quality camera
that is set to take photos and videos at 30 fps and 1080p. The GPS system on the iPhone can determine the device’s
location using signals from GPS satellites, which are upto 2m accurate (shown in MATLAB app).
