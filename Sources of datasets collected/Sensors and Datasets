We have collected three datasets using an iPhone following the same trajectory and analyzed the data through
different algorithms to obtain a mapping of the area in various forms.
Firstly, we have installed an application called ”Record3D” on the iPhone that scans the area and gives LiDAR
data. This application can stream live data in two ways: via USB and over Wi-Fi. RTAB-Map is also installed as an
application on the Windows laptop that performs the mapping. The iPhone’s camera is calibrated manually and the
camera intrinsics are obtained. The LiDAR data obtained is saved as a sequence of images which is then processed
by the RTAB-Map algorithm via USB live streaming.
Secondly, using an iPhone camera an RGB video is recorded and processed by the PySLAM 2 algorithm that
detects visual landmarks to obtain the 2D and 3D trajectory.
Thirdly, utilizing the MATLAB application on iPhone consisting of motion sensors - Gyroscope, Magnetometer
and Accelerometer, we performed dead-reckoning. The sensors on the iPhone are already calibrated off the shelf.
