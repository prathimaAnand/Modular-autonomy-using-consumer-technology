In conclusion, the project aimed to develop a system for modular autonomy using consumer technology, specifically an
iPhone equipped with LiDAR, IMU, camera, and GPS sensors. The system was able to generate a map using LiDAR
data and RTAB-Map, perform visual SLAM using camera data and PySLAM, and perform dead reckoning using
IMU data and MATLAB-Mobile. The predicted paths from these three approaches were compared and evaluated.
The results of this project, i - SLAM, demonstrate the feasibility of using an iPhone to enable autonomous behavior
in a mobile platform, such as an RC car or drone. Potential applications of this system include reconnaissance, delivery
robots, disaster response, and exploring mines. However, it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs between
different approaches and choose the one that is most appropriate for the task at hand. As a potential improvement
to the current system, it may be beneficial to combine multiple approaches to take advantage of the strengths of each
approach and mitigate their weaknesses
